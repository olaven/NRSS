## Known Problems

- Some clients may not accept a feed hosted over HTTPS only. See @steinarb's workaround [here](https://github.com/olaven/NRSS/issues/5#issuecomment-1488840679) for a possible solution.
- The feeds only provide the latest episodes for a podcast, not the entire archive. I've not yet found any acceptable method of fetching all episodes without getting rate limited by NRK or introducing a storage layer. This is tracked in https://github.com/olaven/NRSS/issues/8.
